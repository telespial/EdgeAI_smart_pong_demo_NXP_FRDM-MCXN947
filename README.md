## Real World AI Learning Demonstration
1. Compare three control behaviors in the same system:
   - `HUMAN`: touch-driven paddle control
   - `ALGO`: fixed classic CPU predictor (non-learning baseline)
   - `EdgeAI`: NPU-assisted predictor with adaptive runtime tuning
2. Observe online learning in live play:
   - The adaptive controller updates from rally outcomes (hits/misses), then changes paddle speed, anticipation, and tracking noise.
   - `SKILL` modes allow direct side comparison:
     - `AI/ALGO`: left uses adaptive EdgeAI, right uses fixed ALGO.
     - `ALGO/AI`: left uses fixed ALGO, right uses adaptive EdgeAI.
     - `2AI`: both sides use adaptive EdgeAI.
3. Validate session learning vs persistent learning:
   - `PERSIST ON`: left/right learned profiles carry across new matches and are restored independently from onboard flash after reboot/power cycle.
   - `PERSIST OFF`: learned profile is cleared, forcing a cold-start behavior.
4. Demonstrate deployment-style tradeoffs:
   - NPU path is used when enabled and available, with CPU fallback always present for robustness.
   - Bottom telemetry helps correlate behavior with NPU/fallback timing and latency trends.

## Gameplay Rules
- Objective: first side to 11 points wins the match.
- Scoring: when a side misses and the ball exits that side, the opponent gains 1 point.
- Ball motion: ball reflects from top and bottom arena walls.
- Paddle collision: ball reflects from paddles with hit-position-based angle shaping ("english").
- Serve behavior: each serve starts from center and is directed toward the side that conceded the previous point.
- Match flow:
  - `P0` (AI vs AI): at 11 points, winner styling + confetti are shown, then the game auto-resets and continues in an endless loop.
  - `P1` and `P2`: at 11 points, winner styling + confetti are shown, then `NEW GAME? YES/NO` is displayed.

## Controls
- Touch control strips at left/right edges:
  - Left strip controls player 1 paddle.
  - Right strip controls player 2 paddle.
  - Touch `Y` controls paddle height.
  - Touch `X` within the strip controls paddle depth.
- UI top bar is reserved for settings.
- Alternate control sources (for example knob mappings) can be routed through `src/platform/input_hal.c`.

## Settings
- `Players`: `0`, `1`, `2`
- `Difficulty`: `1`, `2`, `3`
- `NPU`: `ON`, `OFF`
- `SKILL`: `2AI`, `AI/ALGO`, `ALGO/AI`
  - `2AI`: both sides adaptive EdgeAI.
  - `AI/ALGO`: left adaptive EdgeAI, right fixed ALGO baseline.
  - `ALGO/AI`: left fixed ALGO baseline, right adaptive EdgeAI.
- `PERSIST`: `ON`, `OFF`
  - `ON`: keep and restore learned AI profiles from flash independently per side.
  - `OFF`: clear learned profiles (including flash snapshot) for true cold-start behavior.
- `MATCH`: `11`, `INF`
- `TARGET`: `ON`, `OFF`
- `SPEED++`: `ON`, `OFF`
- `New Game`: immediate score reset

## AI and NPU Implementation
- This firmware uses an embedded TensorFlow Lite Micro model run via the eIQ Neutron NPU backend.
- Runtime has two AI paths:
  - CPU analytic intercept predictor (deterministic fallback)
  - NPU-assisted predictor path
- NPU path is enabled by `CONFIG_EDGEAI_USE_NPU=y`.
- Inference stack:
  - TensorFlow Lite Micro runtime
  - eIQ Neutron delegate/backend for NPU execution
- AI behavior:
  - Predicts paddle intercept targets (`y_hit`, `z_hit`, `t_hit`) for tracking.
  - Difficulty presets apply reaction-time limits, speed limits, and tracking noise.
  - `AI ON/OFF` controls whether the NPU-assisted path is used; CPU fallback remains available.
- Runtime telemetry:
  - On-screen telemetry shows NPU invoke rate, fallback rate, last inference latency, and moving-average latency.
  - Telemetry is displayed in AI-controlled modes (`P0`, `P1`) when AI is enabled.
- Current embedded NPU model artifact is integrated in `src/npu/` and linked into flash (`.model` section).

## Features
- 3D-look arena with depth cues, wall shading, and segmented score digits
- 0P / 1P / 2P modes
- Ball-speed-linked color gradient (red to green)
- 0P accelerometer perturbation of ball trajectory (`vy`, `vz`) for live outcome nudging
- New-game countdown (`3`, `2`, `1`; red/yellow/green) on game start only
- Fixed-timestep simulation
- Real-time NPU telemetry overlay for performance tuning
- `SKILL` setting for side-selectable adaptive AI vs baseline ALGO (`2AI`, `AI/ALGO`, `ALGO/AI`)
- Optional `SPEED++` progression: whenever either side reaches `11, 22, 33, ...`, serve speed target increases by `5%` (compounding) and is capped by runtime speed limits
